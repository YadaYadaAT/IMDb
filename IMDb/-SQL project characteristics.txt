-SQL project characteristics:
 1)Constraints almost in every single attribute so as to ensure the correct data values(email structure,urls,dates diffs e.t.c)
2)Optimization by indexing(nonclustered) columns of specific tables such us UsersVote(ReviewID) to increase perfomance.
3)Carefully attached triggers(no cursor/lock) to keep the tables up to date(e.x VideosNum e.t.c) without affecting the perfomance.
4)Scheduled Daily Procedures/Jobs(Update Mov/Ser votes and ReviewNum) at 5 am-6 am low traffic hours
5)All counts and any other statements are carefully made in order to avoid needless repetitiveness and therefore boost perfomance.
